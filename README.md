# Alice Internationalized

An online, internationalized version of Alice in Wonderland.

The text and images are taken from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/).

Because each translation is its own edition and formatted differently, there may be formatting errors or misalignment between translations. Feel free to make a PR of any translation or formatting errors you have noticed.

Please note that the legality of Gutenberg depends on your country. If you are in a country where Project Gutenberg's library is not legal, continue at your own risk.
